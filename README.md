# Statistical-Computing-Course

This is a course which will cover a range of topics in statistical computing. I will be uploading new lessons weekly. The pre-requisites for this course are a sound knowledge of algebra and programming knowledge with R and Python, as i will be using them in examples. More importantly you will need a love for statistics! 

I hope these notes will help you as much as they have helped me.
